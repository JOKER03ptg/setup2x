This directory contains scripts that automate the process of setting up the
development toolchain for the gp2x.

Make sure that /opt/open2x exists and is writable and execute ./setup.sh

supertux should be located in ../supertux (relative to this README file). You
can then setup supertux with ./supertux.sh.

Warning: cmake only creates Makefiles outside the supertux source directory if
there aren't already Makefiles in the supertux directory. If you already have
Makefiles in the supertux dir, delete the CMakeFiles directory and *.cmake
(except config.h.cmake).  (Matze: Is there a cmake or make command to automate
this like "make cvsclean" in automake did?)
